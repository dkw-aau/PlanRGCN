# Experiments on Existing SPARQL QPP work


Neural Network and support vector machine classification models code in this directory is refactored code of the experiments from sparql-query-exec-prediction-model that implements the proposed solution from "A neural network approach to SPARQL query execution time prediction" and ....
This repo also contains the reimplementation of the two-step SVM approach from "".
