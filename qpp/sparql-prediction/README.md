# Two Step Latency Prediction
NOTE: current this prediction model does not work at all with the queries from "A neural network approach to SPARQL Latency Prediction" due to the latency being to diverse (fails at xmeans).
This approach does not seem to work well with the queries from "A neural network approach to SPARQL Latency Prediction".
